# Code Lab Session 1: Let's get organized.

Today's topics:

- **Getting Started**. How do I even open the files, and what program do I use, and how do I see the website?
- **Text editors**. How do I change the files?
- **HTML, CSS, & JS: How it all comes together.** What the heck do I put in the files so that the website shows up?
- **File and folder naming**. Where do the files live on my computer (paths), and how can I access them from my website (hyperlinks)?
- **CSS Cascading (css order and hierarchy)**. I don't like how the website looks by default. What are my options?
- **Development environment setup** All of this toggling between windows and hitting `âŒ˜-R` is tiresome.
- **Testing & Debugging**. Something went wrong. What now?
