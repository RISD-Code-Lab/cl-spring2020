      <h1>Code Lab — Spring 2020</h1>
      <p>
        Code Lab provides foundational skills training for folks interested in computation basics. It will be especially targeted towards students enrolled in <a href="https://mkim.netlify.com/gdtsns20/" class="class-name">Generative Design: Tool, System, Network</a>, <a href="https://risd-web.github.io/webtype-spring2020/" class="class-name">Web Type</a>, or <span class="class-name">Machine Learning and Design</span>, but is open to all RISD / Brown students and faculty. This won’t be for credit, it won’t assign projects, and it won’t require any commitment other than showing up. It’s about providing support for students enrolled in rigorous computational courses who want it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lab section will be about 60–90 minutes and will meet 6 to 9 times over the course of the semester. Each meeting will introduce a topic or tool, and its format will vary from technical lectures to project-based demos.
