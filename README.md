# Code Lab Spring 2020

Code Lab provides foundational skills training for folks interested in computation basics. It will be especially targeted towards students enrolled in Generative Design: Tool, System, Network [GRAPH-2310-01 (31423)], Web Type [GRAPH-2313-01], or  Machine Learning and Design [GRAPH-2314]. This wonâ€™t be for credit, it wonâ€™t assign projects, and it wonâ€™t require any commitment other than showing up. Itâ€™s about providing support for students enrolled in rigorous computational courses who want it.

The lab section will be about 90 minutes and will meet 6 to 9 times over the course of the semester. Each meeting will consist of introducing a concept, providing you a short prompt/exercise designed to help you learn the concept, and then open work time, where weâ€™ll walk around and support you as you solve the problem.

ðŸ‘‰**Please [sign up here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UJF4e9RK39tvByTza2kSOql0mAdfO2C_T2cvvQUYP0s/edit?usp=sharing) by the Sunday prior to the session you plan to attend.** This way we can plan for the appropriate number of students.

# Schedule
