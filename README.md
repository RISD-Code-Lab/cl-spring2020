Wednesdays 5:00pmâ€“6:30pm | Design Center Room 212*

*NOTE: For Wednesday March 11, we will be in Design Center **Room 501**.

Code Lab provides foundational skills training for folks interested in computation basics. It will be especially targeted towards students enrolled in [[Generative Design: Tool, System, Network](https://mkim.netlify.com/gdtsns20/)], [[Web Type](https://risd-web.github.io/webtype-spring2020/)], or [Machine Learning and Design]. This wonâ€™t be for credit, it wonâ€™t assign projects, and it wonâ€™t require any commitment other than showing up. Itâ€™s about providing support for students enrolled in rigorous computational courses who want it.

The lab section will be about 90 minutes and will meet 6 to 9 times over the course of the semester. Each meeting will consist of introducing a concept, providing you a short prompt/exercise designed to help you learn the concept, and then open work time, where weâ€™ll walk around and support you as you solve the problem.

ðŸ‘‰**Please [sign up here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UJF4e9RK39tvByTza2kSOql0mAdfO2C_T2cvvQUYP0s/edit?usp=sharing) by the Sunday prior to the session you plan to attend.** This way we can plan for the appropriate number of students.

# Schedule

## Code Lab Session 5: Ready, set, loop with Drawbot
Based off of the concepts introduced two weeks ago in Session 3, weâ€™ll have a hands-on workshop using Python 3 and [Drawbot](https://jquery.com/). 

## Code Lab Session 4: Ready, set, loop with jQuery
Based off of the concepts introduced last week, weâ€™ll have a hands-on workshop using [jQuery](https://jquery.com/). Weâ€™ll also introduce the JSON data structure as a possible application of JavaScript.

## Code Lab Session 3:Â Ready, set, loop
Weâ€™ll be introducing fundamental programming concepts that are relevant both on the web with JavaScript / jQuery, as well as Python.

- Basic Datatypes (Integers, Strings, Variables, Booleans)
- Structures (Lists, Objects)
- Iteration (Loops)
- Functions and Methods

## Code Lab Session 2: Letâ€™s talk terminal

- Introduction to the terminal
- Navigating the filesystem
- Running programs
- Installing packages

## Code Lab Session 1: Letâ€™s get organized

- Getting Started
- Text editors
- HTML, CSS, & JS: How it all comes together
- File and folder naming, where they live (paths), and how to access them (hyperlinks)
- CSS Cascading (css order and hierarchy) 
- Development environment setup
- Testing & Debugging

We will be designing future sessions based off of student needs and interests over the course of the semester.
